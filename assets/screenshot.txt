This would be a screenshot showing:

1. The 2D constituency parse tree on the left tab
2. The 3D semantic visualization on the right tab with nodes colored by semantic value and positioned according to their semantic meaning
3. The interactive Streamlit UI with sentence input field at the top

The image would demonstrate how the Tree-LSTM creates a compositional semantic representation of a sentence, visualized in both 2D syntax tree form and 3D semantic space.
